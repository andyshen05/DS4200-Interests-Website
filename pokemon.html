    <h3 class="interest">General Context:</h3>
    <p>
        The first Pokemon games were released in 1996, being Pokemon Red, Blue, and Yellow, which all follow a very similar plot.
        The protagonist will usually pick their starter companion out of 3 options. Throughout your journey you will have
        plenty of chances to capture new Pokemon and battle other trainers. By defeating other
        Pokemon in battles using their unique moves, the Pokemon you use will gain experience and eventually improve their
        statistics by leveling up. The game has milestone battles, known as Gyms. These gyms usually give great rewards and special
        moves when beaten, and the player's eventual goal is to defeat the Elite Four, a set of 4 consecutive trainers with very
        high-leveled pokemon! 
    </p>
    <h3 class="interest">Mechanics</h3>
    <p>
        Each Pokemon has up to 2 types, and each move also has a corresponding type. There are 18 types in total, shown in the
        image below.
    </p>
    <img src="https://www.esports.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pokemonTypes.webp" 
    alt="Pokemon Types" style = width:600px;height:337px>
    <p>
        Each type interacts with other types in different amounts of damage, being as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li style="color:red">Immune - 0x damage</li>
        <li style="color:orange">Not very Effective - 0.5x damage</li>
        <li style="color:rgb(118, 164, 27)">Neutral - 1x damage</li>
        <li style="color:rgb(16, 154, 16)">Super Effective - 2x damage</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Of course, there are a large variety of moves that Pokemon can use, each with their own damage values and additional effects.
        There are game mechanics like statuses, which can hinder or help Pokemon, accuracy to cause moves to miss, and even more!
    </p>
    <h3 class="interest">What Makes Pokemon Fun?</h3>
    <p>
        I think the brilliance of Pokemon comes from the way it builds the relationship between the player and the in-game characters
        and Pokemon. As the story progresses and the player gets to physically see their hard work pay off with each defeated gym 
        or each quest finished, they become more attached to their Pokemon and maybe even to the characters they interact with. 
        It really embodies a marathon over a sprint, and is super rewarding when the game is finished. A lot of detail and thought was
        put into every game in the franchise, and I can't wait for the oppertunity to experience it all!
