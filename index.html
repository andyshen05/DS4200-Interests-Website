    <p>
        Hey there! My name is Andy Shen, and I am a sophomore student at Northeastern studying Data Science and Mathematics!
        For some general context, I am currently 19, and I was born in North Carolina. I later moved to Massachusetts, and have 
        been in this general area ever since! I have many hobbies, which I have accumulated throughout my life, all of which are 
        pretty different from each other. Such hobbies include swimming, violin, biking, video games, and acapella. And that’s not 
        even including my love and dedicated passion for data science! Of course there are many, many other activities that I have 
        enjoyed multiple times throughout my life, but these are the main core few that I have really enjoyed consistently for 
        multiple years. Unfortunately, my access to most of these activities were halted during the pandemic, but now that it has 
        mostly passed, I am beginning to reintegrate those activities into my life whenever possible. I hope you enjoy my 
        website, and get to learn a bit about me! If you have any feedback or questions, or even just want to chat and talk with 
        me, feel free to email me at shen.andy@northeastern.edu. I can’t wait to hear from you!
    </p>

        My first exposure to the Pokemon franchise was in late 2016, with the release of Pokemon Go.
        In fact, almost everyone was outside walking around trying to <i>catch 'em all</i>! Pokemon is all about fostering
        relationships with your team, and using their strengths to your advantage! If you'd like to learn more about it you can
        check out the seperate website I made using the button above.

        Since I began my introduction to Pokemon, I've made it my personal goal to beat at least one game from each of the 
        franchise's 9 generations! Currently I have beaten:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li style="color:green">Pokemon Emerald (Generation 3)</li>
        <li style="color:green">Pokemon SoulSilver (Generation 2)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Currently playing: Pokemon LeafGreen (Generation 1)</p>
